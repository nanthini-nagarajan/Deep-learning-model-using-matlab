# Section 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing

The code loads a medical imaging dataset from a folder using imageDatastore.
It sets the label source to "foldernames", which means that the labels are derived from the folder names.
It displays 20 random images from the dataset using imshow.
It divides the dataset into 70% training and 30% validation sets using splitEachLabel.

# Section 2: Data Augmentation

The code creates an imageDataAugmenter object to perform data augmentation on the training set.
It specifies random X-reflection, X-translation, and Y-translation as augmentation techniques.
It converts the training and validation sets to augmented image datastores using augmentedImageDatastore.

# Section 3: Model Definition

The code loads a pre-trained AlexNet model using alexnet.
It extracts the input size of the first layer of the AlexNet model.
It defines a new neural network architecture by removing the last three layers of the AlexNet model and adding a fully connected layer, a softmax layer, and a classification layer.

# Section 4: Model Training

The code specifies training options using trainingOptions, including the mini-batch size, maximum number of epochs, initial learning rate, and validation frequency.
It trains the model using trainNetwork with the augmented training set and the specified training options.

# Section 5: Model Evaluation

The code evaluates the trained model on the validation set using classify.
It displays four random images from the validation set with their predicted labels using imshow.
It calculates the accuracy of the model on the validation set using mean.
It plots a confusion matrix using plotconfusion.

# Section 6: Model Analysis

The code extracts details of the first convolutional layer (conv1) of the AlexNet model, including the filter size, number of filters, stride, and padding.
It displays the extracted information using disp.
